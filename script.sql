Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as 
"Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery".
Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.

SELECT SUM(po) as putouts,
	CASE WHEN pos = 'OF' THEN 'Outfield'
		WHEN pos = 'SS' THEN 'Infield'
		WHEN pos = '2B' THEN 'Infield'
		WHEN pos = '3B' THEN 'Infield'
		WHEN pos = '1B' THEN 'Infield'
		WHEN pos = 'P' THEN 'Battery'
		WHEN pos = 'C' THEN 'Battery' END as position
FROM fielding
WHERE yearid = '2016'
GROUP BY position
ORDER BY putouts DESC;

Answer:
	Infield - 58934
	Battery - 41424
	Outfield - 29560
